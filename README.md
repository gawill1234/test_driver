# test_driver
A driver to run tests.

More information coming.

This is a test driver.  It will take a list of tests and run them.  Then save the results for
later review.

The tests are easy.  It can be ANY executable provided that the executable has an exit status.
The default is exit 0 (zero) means pass.  Anything else is a fail.  It can be changed.

There is a one item test list (goofy.gtd) as an example.  Each line in the file should be one test.
